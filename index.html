					<h2>Literature Review</h2>
					<textarea data-template>
						### Literature Review
						##### Several studies have highlighted the potential benefits of e-commerce platforms for agro-producers.

						---
						**Research has explored how direct marketing strategies (e.g., farmers markets and direct-to-consumer sales) are used by agricultural producers to enhance profitability and bypass middlemen. Studies show that factors such as farm size, location, and crop type influence the adoption of direct marketing channelsâ€‹**
